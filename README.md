This is an example of a transportation problem. 
A transportation problem involves the shipment of items from a set of sources to a set of sinks (the sources and sinks must form disjoint sets), the problem seeks to minimize the cost of shipping. In
this case study crates of beer must be shipped from two breweries to five bars.
